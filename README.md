# Revolution — Intelligent Opportunity Matching & Knowledge-Centric Design System

**Revolution** is a modular prototype that blends knowledge-driven personalization, semantic opportunity matching, and rapid UI prototyping.  
It unifies a **FastAPI backend**, **Streamlit demo frontend**, and a **Knowledge-Base layer** with matching algorithms to recommend relevant opportunities (jobs, internships, or projects) tailored to individual users.

## 🧩 Overview

**Revolution** is a research-grade and product-ready foundation for **personalized opportunity discovery**.

It provides:
- A **FastAPI** backend for serving recommendations.
- A **Streamlit** UI for real-time demos and stakeholder testing.
- A **Knowledge-Base (KB)** for canonical skill and domain representation.
- A **Matching Engine** for personalized ranking of opportunities.
- A **Design System** for a unified and modern UI theme.

This project demonstrates how ML-driven personalization can be rapidly prototyped into a working system while maintaining modularity and academic clarity.
